My-Ministry - Jquery Mobile BB10 Version
========================================

An HTML5 BlackBerry app for managing preaching by missionaries and ministers.  The Jquery Mobile version for BB10.

## The Basics
There are no files here yet - project under construction.
You can use the current version of Ripple to test and compile the app.  If you would like to contribute to the code then please do so.  Since this project is in HTML5 it would not take much to port it to iOS for Apple.  Only the bbui.js / css which is specific to BlackBerry would need to be ported.  This version uses JQuery Mobile as its base.
